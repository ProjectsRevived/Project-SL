Project SL
Created with the intent to sideload games or apps onto other platforms in which downloads would
be blocked, this could include work, or sometimes school computers, however it does not work for
chromebooks not running linux.
HOW IT WORKS
Project SL is created by the makers of ReadyPad. It works by creating a software that can easily bypass
software used to block applications and can be sideloaded onto a computer. Sideloading is tcopy or
transfer (data) from one device to another directly, typically by means of a link such as a USB cable or
wireless connection.
Error Possibilities. Errors occur at multiple times, however when these do occur, you need to know
what should happen to prevent these errors from happening again, or fixing these errors.
(1) Replug the transfer device;
(2) Run the included bug software
(3) Restart the computer and sideload the apps back on
(4) Uninstall all sideloaded apps and run off of the SLV
If none of these fix the apps, this could mean that the code needs fixing, in this case, you would
wait for another update to the SLV and transfer device. In this case there is nothing you can do until the
update is published.
Sideload Virtual. In the case you are not willing to SL the games onto your computer, you can run
them off the transfer device. This is called SLV because it is still sideloading, but instead running off
of a portable transfer device allowing saves between users, you will have to get a profile created
before the SLV works otherwise it will save one game file to all users
